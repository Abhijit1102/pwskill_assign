    "`Web scraping` is the automated process of extracting data from websites using software tools. The software tools, also known as `web scrapers`, can access web pages, extract the data from them, and save the data into a structured format such as a spreadsheet or a `database`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Web scraping` is used to gather large amounts of data from various websites quickly and efficiently. It allows businesses and individuals to extract data from online sources for research, analysis, and marketing purposes. Here are three areas where web scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `E-commerce`: Web scraping is used to extract product information such as prices, descriptions, and images from e-commerce websites. This data can be used to monitor competitors' pricing strategies, analyze consumer trends, and optimize pricing for your own products.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Market research`: Web scraping can be used to collect data on customer reviews, social media mentions, and other online content related to your industry or market. This data can be analyzed to identify consumer preferences and trends, monitor competitors, and inform product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Financial analysis`: Web scraping is used by financial analysts to extract data such as stock prices, earnings reports, and economic indicators from financial websites. This data can be used to track market trends, monitor individual companies, and inform investment decisions."

    "1. `Manual scraping`: This involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or other format. This method is time-consuming and not ideal for large-scale data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `XPath and CSS selectors`: These are techniques for selecting specific HTML elements on a web page using XPath or CSS syntax. Once the elements are selected, the data can be extracted using programming languages such as Python or JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Web scraping libraries and frameworks`: These are pre-built tools that allow developers to automate the process of web scraping. Popular libraries and frameworks include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `API scraping`: Some websites offer APIs (application programming interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. API scraping involves querying these APIs to extract the desired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Headless browsing`: This technique involves using a browser automation tool to interact with a web page as a human user would. This allows the scraper to bypass certain anti-scraping measures implemented by websites, such as CAPTCHAs."

    "3. `Store data`: Flask can be used to store scraped data in a database or file system. This allows the data to be easily accessed and analyzed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Automate the scraping process`: Flask can be used to automate the web scraping process by scheduling scraping jobs and running them in the background. This makes it possible to scrape data on a regular basis without manual intervention."

    "\n",
    "3. `S3 (Simple Storage Service)`: S3 is an object storage service that can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data, such as scraped data files. S3 can also be used to host static web content, such as scraped web pages or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Glue`: Glue is a fully managed ETL (extract, transform, and load) service that can be used to prepare and transform scraped data for analysis. Glue can be used to clean and normalize scraped data, convert it to a different format, and load it into a data warehouse or analytics tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Athena`: Athena is an interactive query service that allows users to analyze data stored in S3 using SQL. Athena can be used to query and analyze scraped data stored in S3, without the need to provision or manage any infrastructure."
