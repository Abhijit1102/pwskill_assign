    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program will raise (or throw) an exception, which can be caught and handled using a try-except statement. This allows the program to recover from the error and continue executing, rather than stopping abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many built-in exceptions in Python, such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, etc. that you can use to handle specific types of errors. Additionally, you can also create your own custom exceptions by creating classes that derive from the `Exception class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Syntax` errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter encounters incorrect syntax in a program. Syntax errors are usually caused by typos, missing punctuation, or incorrect indentation. They are detected when the program is first parsed, before it begins execution. Unlike exceptions, syntax errors cannot be caught and handled at runtime, and they prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, exceptions occur during the execution of a program and are used to handle errors that occur at runtime. Syntax errors occur before the program begins execution and are caused by incorrect syntax in the code."
