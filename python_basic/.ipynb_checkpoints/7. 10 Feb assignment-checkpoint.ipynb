    "\n",
    "- `'r'` (Read Only) - This mode opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'w'` (Write Only) - This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated, and if it does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'a'` (Append Only) - This mode opens the file for writing, but unlike 'w', it does not truncate the file. Instead, it appends the data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'x'` (Exclusive Creation) - This mode opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, an error is raised. This mode is used to create a new file that is not yet available for reading or writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'b'` (Binary) - This mode is used to open the file in binary mode. In binary mode, data is read and written as a sequence of bytes. This mode is usually used when reading or writing binary files such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'t'` (Text) - This mode is used to open the file in text mode. In text mode, data is read and written as strings. This mode is the default mode and is usually used when reading or writing text files."

    "- Releasing Resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates memory and other resources to handle the file. Closing the file frees up these resources, allowing them to be used by other programs or processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preventing Data Corruption: If a file is not closed properly, the data that is written to the file may be incomplete or inconsistent. Closing the file ensures that all data is written to the file and that the file is in a consistent state.\n",

    "- Improving Performance: Keeping a large number of files open can have a negative impact on the performance of your program. Closing files that are no longer needed frees up resources, improving the performance of your program.\n",

    "- Preventing Conflicts: If multiple programs or processes try to access the same file at the same time, conflicts can arise. Closing a file after it has been used ensures that other programs or processes can access the file without conflict."
