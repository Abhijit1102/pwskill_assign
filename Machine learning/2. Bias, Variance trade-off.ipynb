This means that the model has learned the noise or random variations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns or relationships. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, which can lead to poor generalization performance.\n",

    "`Underfitting` occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns or relationships in the data. This means that the model has not learned enough from the training data and is unable to generalize well to new, unseen data. As a result, the model performs poorly on both the training and test data.\n",

    "The consequences of `overfitting` and `underfitting` are different. Overfitting can lead to high variance and low bias, while underfitting can lead to high bias and low variance. In both cases, the model's performance is suboptimal, and it is important to mitigate these problems to improve the accuracy and reliability of the model.\n",

    "1. `Regularization`: This involves adding a penalty term to the loss function of the model to discourage complex or overfitting solutions.\n",

    "\n",

    "`Train-Test Split`: A simple way to detect overfitting and underfitting is to split the data into a training set and a test set. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set, it may be overfitting. If the model performs poorly on both the training and test sets, it may be underfitting.\n",

If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set, it may be overfitting. If the model performs poorly on both the training and test sets, it may be underfitting. Learning curves and cross-validation can also provide insights into the model's performance and help identify whether it is overfitting or underfitting. Finally, regularization can be used to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability."
