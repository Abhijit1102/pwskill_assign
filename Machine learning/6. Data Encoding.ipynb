    "`Data encoding` refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. It involves the transformation of raw data into a format that is suitable for storage, transmission, and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, data encoding is essential for several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `First`, data encoding allows data to be stored efficiently, reducing the amount of space required to store the data. This can be especially important when dealing with large datasets that may be too big to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Second`, data encoding can help ensure data integrity and consistency. By using a standardized encoding scheme, data scientists can avoid errors that might occur when data is transferred between different systems or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Third`, data encoding is important for data analysis and machine learning. Many algorithms require input data to be encoded in a specific format, such as numeric values or one-hot encoded categorical variables. By properly encoding the data, data scientists can ensure that the algorithms they use are able to process the data correctly."

This means that nominal encoding is useful when the categories of a variable are just labels without any inherent order or rank, and treating them as a series of binary features through one-hot encoding may not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One practical example of when `nominal encoding` is preferred over one-hot encoding is in natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis. Suppose we have a dataset of movie reviews, and one of the variables is the sentiment of the review, which could be positive, negative, or neutral. Since there is no inherent order between these categories, nominal encoding would be an appropriate technique to encode this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use one-hot encoding, we would create three binary features, one for each sentiment category. However, this approach would not be optimal for sentiment analysis because it would not capture the relationship between the different sentiment categories. For example, positive and neutral reviews may have more in common than negative and neutral reviews, but one-hot encoding would not capture this relationship.\n",

    "In contrast, nominal encoding would assign a unique integer value to each sentiment category, allowing us to capture the relationship between them. For example, we could assign positive a value of 1, neutral a value of 2, and negative a value of 3."
