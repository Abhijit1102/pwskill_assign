    "- 1. `Range` is a simple measure of dispersion that represents the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It is easy to calculate but can be sensitive to outliers. For example, if we have a dataset of test scores ranging from 60 to 100, the range would be 40.\n",

It is calculated by squaring the difference between each data point and the mean, summing these values, and dividing by the number of data points minus one. Variance is useful because it gives a sense of how much the data points deviate from the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of test scores with a mean of 80 and a variance of 100, we know that the scores are more spread out than a dataset with a variance of 25.\n",

For example, if we have a dataset of test scores with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10, we can say that most of the scores fall within 10 points of the mean."

However, in a skewed distribution, the data is not evenly distributed around the mean, and the tail of the distribution is longer on one side than the other. Skewness can be positive or right-skewed, negative or left-skewed, or zero, indicating no skewness. Positive skewness means that the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side, while negative skewness means that the tail of the distribution is longer on the left side.
