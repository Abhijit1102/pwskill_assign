Some of the key concepts in statistics include probability, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, correlation, and sampling.

    "1. `Descriptive statistics`: This type of statistics deals with the collection, presentation, and summary of data. It describes the characteristics of a dataset using measures such as central tendency, variability, and frequency distribution. Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize and visualize data in a way that is easy to understand. Some examples of when descriptive statistics might be used include:\n",
    "   - A business wants to understand the sales performance of its products. Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize sales data by product, region, or time period to identify trends and patterns.\n",
    "   - A researcher wants to summarize the results of a survey. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the average response, the most common response, and the range of responses for each question.\n",
    "2. `Inferential statistics`: This type of statistics deals with making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. It involves using probability theory to test hypotheses and draw conclusions from a sample about a larger population. Some examples of when inferential statistics might be used include:\n",
    "   - A medical researcher wants to test a new drug. Inferential statistics can be used to determine if the drug is significantly more effective than a placebo by comparing the outcomes of the treatment group to the control group.\n",
    "   - A pollster wants to estimate the percentage of voters who support a particular candidate. Inferential statistics can be used to calculate a margin of error that reflects the degree of uncertainty in the estimate due to sampling variability.\n",

Different levels of measurement have different characteristics, and therefore require different analytical approaches.\n",

This means that you can use more advanced statistical methods, such as correlation and regression analysis, to analyze the relationships between income and other variables. However, if you have data on the favorite colors of individuals, the level of measurement would be nominal.
