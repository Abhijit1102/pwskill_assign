    "A`database` is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed on a computer system. It can be accessed, managed, and updated by authorized users, and it allows users to efficiently organize and retrieve large amounts of data. A database typically consists of one or more tables, with each table containing rows (also known as records) and columns (also known as fields) that hold specific types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQL` vs `NoSQL` databases\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQL` (Structured Query Language) and `NoSQL` (Not Only SQL) are two types of database systems that differ in their data models, scalability, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQL` databases are relational databases that use tables to store and manage data. The data in a SQL database is organized into tables, with each table having a specific schema that defines the structure and relationships between the data. `SQL` databases are known for their strong consistency, well-defined schemas, and support for complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "`NoSQL` databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that use documents, key-value pairs, or graphs to store and manage data. `NoSQL` databases are designed to be highly scalable and performant, and they can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. `NoSQL` databases are known for their flexibility, high availability, and support for distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key differences between `SQL` and `NoSQL` databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data model`: `SQL` databases use a relational data model, while `NoSQL` databases use a non-relational data model.\n",
    "- `Schema`: `SQL` databases have a well-defined schema that is enforced at the database level, while `NoSQL` databases have a flexible schema that can evolve over time.\n",
    "- `Scalability`: `NoSQL` databases are designed to be highly scalable, and they can easily handle large volumes of data and traffic. `SQL` databases, on the other hand, are not as scalable and may require complex partitioning and sharding techniques to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "- `Querying`:` SQL` databases are optimized for complex queries and support a wide range of `SQL` queries, while NoSQL databases are optimized for simple queries and may not support complex queries or joins.\n",
    "- `Consistency`: `SQL` databases offer strong consistency guarantees, while `NoSQL` databases may offer eventual consistency or other weaker consistency models.\n",
    "- `Availability`: `NoSQL` databases are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant, while `SQL` databases may require more manual intervention to ensure high availability and reliability."
